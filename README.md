👋 Hey there! I'm your Webflow Wizard! 🔮

🏠 Based in Serbia, but I’m all over the internet, crafting modern websites and turning them into pure magic with Webflow. 🚀

🗣️ I speak English like I’m from downtown London (I’m not, but close enough), and Serbian is my native language—so pick your language, I’m game.

🌱 Building websites and turning ideas into reality is my jam. You know that feeling when you see a website and think, "Wow, this place has some serious vibe"? That's what keeps me going every day. Web development is my zen. I learn something new from every bug, and every project is like adding an extra shot of espresso to my productivity. ☕

⚙️ So, what can I do for you?

🎨 Figma to Webflow - Got a Figma design? Sweet! I'll turn it into a stunning Webflow website that will captivate your audience and represent your brand like a boss.

📚 Blog Creation - Your blog, your rules. Let’s make it engaging, memorable, and a place where your audience keeps coming back for more.

🛒 E-commerce Solutions - Online shopping doesn’t have to be boring. We’ll build a Webflow store that’s easy to use and looks so good, credit cards might just leap out of wallets.

📱 Responsive Design - No worries here; your site will look fantastic on every screen size. No more "zoom in, zoom out" games. 😅

🧠 Xano Development - Need a robust backend without the headaches? I’ve got you covered with Xano. Seamlessly integrate your data and power up your Webflow site.

🔍 Technical SEO - Got a great site but need more eyeballs on it? I’ll make sure Google loves your site as much as you do with top-notch technical SEO.

✍️ Copywriting - Words matter! Let’s craft some killer copy that tells your story and sells your vision, all in a tone that sounds like, well, you!

In short...
"I want to make change..."
"I want to integrate..."
"I want to add..."
"I want to transform..."
"I need better copy..."
"I need better SEO..."
"I need to optimize..."
"I need a landing page..."
"I need a sales page..."
"I want a blog..."
"I want an ecommerce..."
"I want to sell more..."
"I want to make more..."
"I just want to say hi..."
"I want to kiss Margot Robbie..."

Relax. You’ve come to the right place.
